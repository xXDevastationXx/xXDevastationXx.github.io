  <h2>Simple</h2>
  <p>Doesn't even have a CSS file attached!</p>
  
  <h3>What does this page do?</h3>
  <p>It does what it should, to be observed and show off simple gimmicks. While the website all together
  is extra simple (no outside files to add to the bandwidth), It remains orderly and not particularly 'ugly'.</p>
  
  <h2>LightWeight </h2>
  <p>Only *** in file size, doesn't have excessive things such as : </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crazy amounts of Jquery/php/javascript</li>
    <li>HyperLinks in every other millimeter</li>
    <li>100*10^50 yottabyte animations</li>
    <li>10 different types of video players</li>
  </ul>
